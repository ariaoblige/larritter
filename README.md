# Larritter
 Changes Twitter a bit to make it look like it was never bought by some billionaire. This userscript was written with [minbrowser](https://github.com/minbrowser/min) in mind, so I cannot say it'll run as expected in other browsers.
## Features
Larritter removes:
 * The 'obtain verified' ad at the top-right of the page;
 * The 'verified' tab in the left section.

Larritter changes:
 * The 'X' logo at the top-left, replacing it with Larry the Bird;
 * The title's 'X' end label gets replaced with 'Twitter';
 * The 'X Corp.' at the bottom-right gets replaced with 'Twitter Inc.';
 * 'See new posts' is changed back to 'See new Tweets';
 * 'Pinned' goes back to 'Pinned Tweet'.
## Plans
 As soon as other changes are noticed by me, I'll try to add them as soon as possible.
