# Larritter
 Changes Twitter a bit to make it look like it was never bought by some billionaire. This userscript was written with [minbrowser](https://github.com/minbrowser/min) in mind, so I cannot say it'll run as expected in other browsers.
## Features
Larritter removes:
 * The 'obtain verified' ad at the top-right of the page;
 * The 'verified' tab in the left section;
 * Views are completely hidden from the main timeline page.

Larritter changes:
 * The 'X' logo at the top-left, replacing it with Larry the Bird;
 * The title's 'X' end label gets replaced with 'Twitter';
 * The 'X Corp.' at the bottom-right gets replaced with 'Twitter Inc.';
 * 'See new posts' is changed back to 'See new Tweets';
 * 'Pinned' goes back to 'Pinned Tweet'.
 * 'Post' buttons are changed back to 'Tweet' (includes 'Post all');

## Known issues
The main page supports all of the previously mentioned features. However, I've noticed some problems:
 * Pages such as profiles or searches won't hide views as of now;
 * It's still possible that some places still call Tweets as posts.

## Plans
 As soon as other changes are noticed by me, I'll try to add them as soon as possible.
